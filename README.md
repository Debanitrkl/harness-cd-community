# Harness Community Edition
This repo contains the files necessary to run Harness CE on your hardware.

We support two methods of installation, [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/).  
If you are unsure which method is right for you, start with Docker Compose.

## Getting started
To get started with Docker Compose read our [Docker Compose instructions](./docker-compose/harness/README.md).

For Helm/Kubernetes, read our [Helm instructions](./helm/README.md).
